--- Day 0: Number Processing Adventure ---

The elves at the North Pole need help processing some calibration numbers! They've given you a list of numbers, and they need you to help them with two important calculations.

--- Part One ---

The elves need to know the total power of all even numbers in their list. They believe even numbers have special magical properties that help their machines run more efficiently.

For example, given these numbers:
1
2
3
4
5

The even numbers are 2 and 4, and their sum is 6.

Your puzzle answer should be the sum of all even numbers in your input.

--- Part Two ---

Now that you've helped with the even numbers, the elves realize they need another calculation. They want to know the strength of all above-average numbers when multiplied together.

Using the same example:
1
2
3
4
5

The mean (average) is 3. The numbers above the mean are 4 and 5.
Multiplying these together: 4 * 5 = 20

Your puzzle answer should be the product of all numbers that are greater than the mean of all numbers in your input.

Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **
